Method Overloading in Java with examples
| FILED UNDER: OOPS CONCEPT

Method Overloading is a feature that allows a class to have more than one method having the same name, if their argument lists are different. It is similar to constructor overloading in Java, that allows a class to have more than one constructor having different argument lists.

letâ€™s get back to the point, when I say argument list it means the parameters that a method has: For example the argument list of a method add(int a, int b) having two parameters is different from the argument list of the method add(int a, int b, int c) having three parameters.
